# Virtual-Drag-and-Drop
Extra Project - Clone of existed project online - Virtual Drag and Drop - Able to drag and drop by using OpenCV and cvzone, along with hand tracking module to make this possible.

The Original Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DxN8G9vB50

The Main Problem Faced: findPosition Error

Solution Used: Use the same cvzone version used as in the video tutorial.

Some minor modification is made to improve the user interface (colour and to terminate the program).
